# Equisoft's GitHub Actions 

Composite actions library to help us write shorter workflows.

Most of our workflows are the same across dozens of repositories and this makes maintenance... painful to say the least. The goal of this repository is to centralize our common workflow logic. We want less duplication across our workflows and easier maintenance tasks.
